# I've adopted Frenk's style of layout. Most automations, components, 
# scripts, etc. are broken up into individual files in a logical
# folder structure (e.g. Automations are in /automations, 
# components like virtual and actual lights are in /components/lights).
#
# While this may seem excessive I believe this will simplify 
# troubleshooting because I will know exactly where to find the 
# reference to the switch.boys_bathroom_nightlight
# (/components/switches/aliases/boys_bathroom_nightlight.yaml). It will
# be much quick to locate each automation and script (/scripts) and
# there won't be any distracting code floating around above or below the
# code I am reviewing.
#
# Look for the following paths:
# * /automations
# * /components
# * /customize
# * /lovelace
# * /packages
# * /scripts
