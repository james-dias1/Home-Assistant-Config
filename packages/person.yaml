# The person component allows to connect device tracker entities to one or more 
# person entities. The last state update of a connected device tracker will set 
# the state of the person. Eg if you connect your router and your owntracks 
# device as trackers to your person, the last state update from either the router 
# or your owntracks device will set the state of your person.
# 
# You can manage persons via the UI from the person page inside the configuration
# panel.
