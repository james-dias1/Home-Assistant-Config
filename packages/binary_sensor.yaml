# Binary sensors gather information about the state of devices which 
# have a “digital” return value (either 1 or 0). These can be switches, 
# contacts, pins, etc. These sensors only have two states: 
# 0/off/low/closed/false and 1/on/high/open/true. Knowing that there are
# only two states allows Home Assistant to represent these sensors in a 
# better way in the frontend according to their functionality.
