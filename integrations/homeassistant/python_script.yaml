# This component allows you to write Python scripts that are exposed as
# services in Home Assistant. Each Python file created in the
# <config>/python_scripts/ folder will be exposed as a service. The content
# is not cached so you can easily develop: edit file, save changes, call
# service. The scripts are run in a sandboxed environment.
