# I highly suggest you to choose short names that you would like to see in the interface
# Naming a light bedroom will also name the light bedroom on the button. I would suggest
# using a name like Lamp for a lamp and Ceiling for a ceiling-lamp. For doors and sensors
# however I would opt for the roomname instead of the sensor name. This will make it much
# easier to distinguish everything in the frontend after you have done this.

# WARNING! If you edit this file, it is best to NOT use the UI to customize entities, you
# probably wouldn't have anyways, but still I need to mention it.
